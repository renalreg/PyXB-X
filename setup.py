Python code for classes that correspond to data structures defined by
`XMLSchema <http://www.w3.org/XML/Schema>`_.  In concept it is similar to
`JAXB <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JAXB>`_ for Java and `CodeSynthesis XSD
<http://www.codesynthesis.com/products/xsd/>`_ for C++.

The major goals of PyXB are:

* Provide a generated Python interface that is "Pythonic", meaning similar
  to one that would have been hand-written:

  + Attributes and elements are Python properties, with name conflicts
    resolved in favor of elements
  + Elements with maxOccurs larger than 1 are stored as Python lists
  + Bindings for type extensions inherit from the binding for the base type
  + Enumeration constraints are exposed as class (constant) variables

* Support bi-directional conversion (document to Python and back)

* Allow easy customization of the generated bindings to provide
  functionality along with content

* Support all XMLSchema features that are in common use, including:

  + complex content models (nested all/choice/sequence)
  + cross-namespace dependencies
  + include and import directives
  + constraints on simple types
